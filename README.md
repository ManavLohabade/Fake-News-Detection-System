## Introduction  
Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, with the rapid spread of misinformation leading to confusion and misinformed decisions. This project provides a solution by utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms to detect fake news efficiently.  

## Features  
- Analyze news articles for authenticity  
- Supervised learning algorithms for classification  
- User-friendly interface for input and output  
- Scalable design for integration into larger systems  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - TensorFlow/Keras  
  - Flask/Django (for web deployment)  
- **Tools:**  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
  - Visual Studio Code  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ManavLohabade/Fake-News-Detection-System.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fake-News-Detection-System  
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the main Python script to start the detection system:
   ```bash
   python app.py  
2. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000.
3 .Enter the text of a news article to check its authenticity.

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake. You can find the dataset here. Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the data folder before running the system.
